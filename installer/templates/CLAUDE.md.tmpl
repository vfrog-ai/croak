# CROAK Project — {{project_name}}

This is a computer vision project managed by the CROAK framework
(Computer Recognition Orchestration Agent Kit).

## Project Configuration

- **Task type:** {{task_type}}
- **Architecture:** {{architecture}}
- **GPU provider:** {{compute_provider}}
- **Experiment tracking:** {{tracking_backend}}

## CROAK Agents

Use slash commands to activate specialized agents:

- `/croak-router` — Pipeline coordinator (start here for guidance)
- `/croak-data` — Data scanning, validation, and preparation
- `/croak-training` — Model training configuration and execution
- `/croak-evaluation` — Model evaluation and error analysis
- `/croak-deployment` — Model export and deployment

## CROAK Workflows

Run end-to-end workflows:

- `/croak-data-preparation` — Full data pipeline (scan → validate → annotate → split → export)
- `/croak-model-training` — Training pipeline (recommend → configure → execute → handoff)
- `/croak-model-evaluation` — Evaluation pipeline (evaluate → analyze → diagnose → report)
- `/croak-model-deployment` — Deployment pipeline (export → optimize → deploy → verify)

## Pipeline State

Current progress is tracked in `.croak/pipeline-state.yaml`.
Always check pipeline state before suggesting next steps.

## Key Directories

- `.croak/` — Framework configuration, agents, workflows, knowledge
- `data/` — Raw and processed datasets
- `training/` — Configs, scripts, and experiment outputs
- `evaluation/` — Evaluation reports and analysis
- `deployment/` — Exported models and deployment packages

## CLI Commands

The `croak` CLI provides these commands:

- `croak scan` — Scan data directory for images
- `croak validate` — Validate data quality
- `croak prepare` — Run full data preparation workflow
- `croak train` — Start model training
- `croak evaluate` — Run model evaluation
- `croak export` — Export model for deployment
- `croak deploy` — Deploy model to cloud or edge
- `croak status` — Check pipeline status

## Conventions

- Always validate data before training
- Use handoff contracts for inter-agent communication
- Update pipeline-state.yaml after completing any workflow stage
- When in doubt, run `croak status` to check current state
- Consult the knowledge base in `.croak/knowledge/` for domain guidance
